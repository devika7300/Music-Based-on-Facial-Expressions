## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras (for building CNN)
- **Languages**: Java (for Android development),  XML (for UI design)
- **Backend**: Firebase (for authentication and data management)
- **APIs**: Spotify API (for music recommendations)
- **Version Control**: Git (for tracking development progress)

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

1. **Mood Detection**: 
   - The app uses a CNN model to analyze facial expressions captured through the device camera.
   - Based on the expression, it classifies the mood into categories such as happy, sad, neutral, etc.

2. **Personalized Music Recommendation**:
   - Once the mood is detected, the app connects to Spotify's API to retrieve playlists that match the user's current mood.
   - Users can immediately start listening to music aligned with their emotional state.

3. **User Interface**:
   - The UI was built using **XML** and provides a seamless user experience with real-time mood detection and music recommendations.
